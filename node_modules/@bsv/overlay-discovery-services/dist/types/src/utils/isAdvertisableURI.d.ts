/**
 * Checks if the provided URI is advertisable, with a recognized URI prefix.
 * Applies scheme-specific validation rules as defined by the BRC-101 overlay advertisement spec.
 *
 * - For HTTPS-based schemes (https://, https+bsvauth+smf://, https+bsvauth+scrypt-offchain://, https+rtt://)
 *   - Uses the URL parser (after substituting the custom scheme with "https:" where needed)
 *   - Disallows "localhost" as hostname
 * - For wss:// URIs (for real-time lookup streaming)
 *   - Ensures valid URL with protocol "wss:" and non-"localhost" hostname
 * - For JS8 Callâ€“based URIs (js8c+bsvauth+smf:)
 *   - Requires a query string with parameters: lat, long, freq, and radius.
 *   - Validates that lat is between -90 and 90 and long between -180 and 180.
 *   - Validates that freq and radius each include a positive number.
 *
 * @param uri - The URI to validate.
 * @returns True if the URI is valid and advertisable, false otherwise.
